Rules, Elements, and Terminology
•	“The Button” – indicates the dealer, rotates clockwise after every hand
•	“Blinds” – Short for blind bets – mandatory bets made before any hands are dealt, made to force action. To play in a hand, players must match the “big blind”. In tournament play, the blinds increase as the game progresses. The player to the Dealer’s left puts out a “small blind”, the player left of the small blind player puts out the “big blind”
•	Every player is dealt 2 cards to start (Hole Cards). These cards are kept secret until the conclusion of the hand.
•	“Call” – player matches the previous bet
•	“Check” – if no player raised the big blind, the player who wagered the big blind may “check”, which is declining to bet or raise the wager any further, or the big blind player may “raise” or wager more of their chips, which the other players must then match to keep playing.
•	“Fold” (aka Muck) – slide cards to center of table. All wagers are forfeited and you may no longer play in the hand.
•	“Flop” – initial dealing of the first three community cards
•	After flop, a player can check if no one has bet yet, or raise.
•	Initial raise must be at least 2 times bigger than the big blind
•	After a raise, a player can Call by matching the raise amount or “Re-raise”, upping the wager again. The reraise must at least match the previous raise amount. Example: Player one raises the wager by $20. Player 2 must match the wager of $20 to call, or reraise the wager amount to at least $40, because he must raise by at least the same amount that player one raised.
•	“The Pot” -  the total of the wagered chips that will go to the winner of a hand.
•	“All-in” – option to raise the wager by pushing all of their chips into the pot
•	After the first round of betting, it is time for the flop, or dealing of the first three community cards.
•	“Burn card” – One card is “burned” or placed face-down on the table, out of play, before any community cards are dealt.
•	“The Flop” – first three community cards, dealt face-up. A card is burned prior to their being dealt. It is followed by a round of betting, then the Turn.
•	“The Turn” (aka fourth street) – the fourth community card, dealt face-up. A card is burned prior to it being dealt. It is followed by a round of betting, then The River.
•	“The River (aka fifth street) – the fifth community card, dealt face-up. A card is burned prior to it being dealt. It is followed by a round of betting, then The Showdown.
•	“The Showdown” – All betting complete, all players show cards. Winner is determined.

Game flow
1.	“Buy in” – How much money you’re bringing to the table. Blind size is dictated by the buy-in. Big blind is 1/200 the buy-in and small blind is 1/400. These values are rounded to the nearest chip value. Example: $50 buy-in  = $.25 big blind, but .25/2 = .125 and we can’t deal with $.01 or smaller values, so the small blind is $.10
2.	New Deck
3.	Shuffle
4.	Deal one card face up to every player. Player with highest card will be the first dealer. Player to the dealer’s left will post the small blind. Player to the small blind’s left will post the big blind.
5.	New Deck
6.	Shuffle
7.	Deal clockwise beginning with the player to the dealer’s left until each player has been dealt 2 cards.
8.	Round 1 of betting
9.	Burn a card and Flop
10.	Round 2 of betting
11.	Burn a card and Turn
12.	Round 3 of betting

14.	Round 4 of betting
15.	Showdown
16.	Return to step 2 until all players but one are eliminated (run out of chips/can’t pay the blinds) or player selects “Quit”
17.	If at any time during a hand all players but one fold, the hand is over and the remaining player wins.
18.	If a player goes all-in and remaining players match it and raise the wager beyond the value of the all-in player’s chips, a side-pot is created. At Showdown, the side pot players’ hands are revealed first and the side-pot is awarded to the highest hand of the two, then then all-in player’s hand is revealed and the winner awarded the pot.
